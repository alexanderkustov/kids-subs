time and you get lucky.

0660 00:40:40:24 00:40:44:16

I think with any company there
is a lot of luck involved.

0661 00:40:45:11 00:40:48:01

You can have great idea and
work really hard and be really

0662 00:40:48:03 00:40:53:14

smart but the one thing that is
out of your control is timing.

0663 00:40:53:16 00:41:00:07

Absolutely, team is super
important, you know, big market

0664 00:41:01:22 00:41:05:14

I don't know, it's magic, it's
totally magic, it's all of that

0665 00:41:05:16 00:41:10:01

stuff and 9 out of 10 times
they fail and the one time it

0666 00:41:10:03 00:41:13:01

does work it happens in a
totally unexpected way.

0667 00:41:13:03 00:41:15:21

Look at Twitter, right, how big
was micro blogging when Twitter

0668 00:41:15:23 00:41:18:05

started. Look at Facebook, how
big was social networking when

0669 00:41:18:07 00:41:20:20

that started. Those weren't huge
interesting markets but that is

0670 00:41:20:22 00:41:24:20

what you hear from all VCs. That
is really what we look for in

0671 00:41:24:22 00:41:27:15

those investments. These weren't
really big investment at the

0672 00:41:27:17 00:41:31:19

time. Starting a company often
feels like series of miracles

0673 00:41:31:21 00:41:35:01

and you have to have one set of
really good thing happen right

0674 00:41:35:03 00:41:40:12

after the other. So it really
does feel like a lot of luck but

0675 00:41:40:14 00:41:45:02

at the same time if you really
work hard and try a lot of things

0676 00:41:45:04 00:41:47:05

and really experimental you can
create your own luck.

0677 00:41:47:07 00:41:48:21

And you can make these
miracles happen.

0678 00:41:48:23 00:41:52:04

When I was young I didn't know
what a entrepreneur was.

0679 00:41:54:06 00:41:59:06

I understood it as a catchall
word to define any independent

0680 00:41:59:08 00:42:02:08

small business person that is
just what I thought but it

0681 00:42:02:10 00:42:05:24

sounded pretentious to me.

0682 00:42:12:21 00:42:17:14

I can't even pinpoint where it
all came from but I just always

0683 00:42:17:16 00:42:22:03

had the impression that I was
going to invent things.

0684 00:42:25:14 00:42:29:01

1999. Pretty soon the site was

college. I loved college,
