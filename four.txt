A primeira startup da Leah
começou como um hobby quando ela jogava

0522 00:31:28:02 00:31:31:11

around with sending messages
and media to her friends. She

0523 00:31:31:13 00:31:34:02

got two of her friends involved
and they turned it into a social

0524 00:31:34:04 00:31:37:24

network. The site got a lot of
attention and at some point

0525 00:31:38:01 00:31:42:03

invitations to use the service
were being sold on eBay.

0526 00:31:42:05 00:31:47:02

My first startup was actually
Pownce and it is sort of a funny

0527 00:31:47:04 00:31:52:00

story because most people will
go through several big failed

0528 00:31:52:02 00:31:54:17

start�ups or little failed
start�ups that no one ever heard

0529 00:31:54:19 00:31:58:02

of before they end up making a
product that is fairly popular.

0530 00:31:58:04 00:32:01:23

Pownce was very popular for a
first start�up It is not really

0531 00:32:02:00 00:32:05:08

the traditional way that
start�ups are built most of the

0532 00:32:05:10 00:32:09:01

time you will have some small
start�up that don't work out

0533 00:32:09:03 00:32:12:19

that well but I was lucky enough
to work with Kevin Rose on

0534 00:32:12:21 00:32:14:23

Pownce who is fairly well known
and ended up getting a lot of

0535 00:32:15:00 00:32:18:06

publicity for my first
start�up.

0536 00:32:18:08 00:32:24:02

Your first startup is really,
really exciting. Everything is

0537 00:32:24:04 00:32:26:14

a big deal and everything
matters and you get T�shirt and

0538 00:32:26:16 00:32:32:13

stickers and it is so exciting
to have sort of your own startup

0539 00:32:32:15 00:32:34:14

A year later the company was
struggling due to a lack of

0540 00:32:34:16 00:32:37:21

revenue. The team decided to
sell Pownce to a software

0541 00:32:37:23 00:32:41:04

company called Six Apart.
Two weeks later the site

0542 00:32:41:06 00:32:43:05

got shut down.

0543 00:32:45:23 00:32:52:01

How did it feel to sell the
company. It was interesting.

0544 00:32:52:03 00:32:53:15

It's kind of exciting because
you are like someone wants to

0545 00:32:53:17 00:32:56:24

buy my company and it's
exciting but at the same time it

0546 00:32:57:01 00:32:59:03

is kind of sad because you lose
sort of the independence and

0547 00:32:59:05 00:33:02:09

freedom to work on the project.
They ended up shutting down the

0548 00:33:02:11 00:33:08:17

site which I wasn't super happy
about so that wasn't a great

0549 00:33:08:19 00:33:13:20

experience. Things can go wrong.
You can end up blaming people.

0550 00:33:13:22 00:33:20:01

You can end up, having a lot of
fighting when things aren't

0551 00:33:20:03 00:33:22:08

going super well and they never
go super well. I don't know why

0552 00:33:22:10 00:33:27:13

anybody thinks that startups are
rainbows and sunshine. It's a

0553 00:33:27:15 00:33:29:24

lot of hard work, I mean if you
want rainbow and sunshine work

0554 00:33:30:01 00:33:32:10

a 9�5 job and have a hobby on
the side because hobbies will

0555 00:33:32:12 00:33:34:23

always be rainbow and sunshine
cause when they don't work out

0556 00:33:35:00 00:33:38:17

you don't want to work on them.
I think there is a part of our

0557 00:33:38:19 00:33:43:09

generation, my generation where
you need to be perfect and good

0558 00:33:43:11 00:33:46:22

in everything and part of being
an entrepreneur is: You will

0559 00:33:46:24 00:33:50:24

fail, you will mess up and do
things wrong. I mean even

0560 00:33:51:01 00:33:53:24

Pownce, the site got shut down,
like, acquired and shut down

0561 00:33:54:01 00:33:56:09

because we ran out of money

0562 00:33:56:11 00:34:01:11

that is kind of a failure but
you need to be able to say that

0563 00:34:01:13 00:34:04:19

is okay and move on from that.
Or something might not work out

0564 00:34:04:21 00:34:08:12

in the way you expect and I
think that is hard for a lot of

0565 00:34:08:14 00:34:12:16

people to know that they are
going to do something wrong.

0566 00:34:18:08 00:34:21:14

Failure is a part of the startup
culture. In the news we only

0567 00:34:21:16 00:34:24:04

hear about the successful
companies but what about all

0568 00:34:24:06 00:34:27:21

the others. 90% of all start�ups
will fail.

0569 00:34:27:23 00:34:29:23

You can't have everyone be a
success, it's just not a

0570 00:34:30:00 00:34:33:17

tenable situation so most
start�ups still do fail but the

0571 00:34:33:19 00:34:36:17

good news is that when those
start�up do fail it is a great

0572 00:34:36:19 00:34:39:01

lesson often times for the
entrepreneurs and you usually

0573 00:34:39:03 00:34:41:03

see a lot of them come back
and try again.

0574 00:34:41:05 00:34:43:05

What is really important is to
make sure that, you know,

0575 00:34:43:07 00:34:46:06

I'm not really putting my
whole identity in this start�up

0576 00:34:46:08 00:34:48:22

and I realize that this
might fail.

0577 00:34:48:24 00:34:54:10

In our experience about 6 out of
10 out of the investments we make

0578 00:34:54:12 00:35:02:06

fail and we lose all our money
and maybe 2 out of 10 float

0579 00:35:02:08 00:35:05:24

along and maybe we make our
money back or maybe two times

0580 00:35:06:01 00:35:12:20

our money so really one or two
of those ten investments that

0581 00:35:12:22 00:35:17:16

make it a huge success that
make venture capital worth

0582 00:35:17:18 00:35:22:13

pursuing and those are the one
or two that make us many, many

0583 00:35:22:15 00:35:24:09

times our money.

0584 00:35:24:11 00:35:26:21

Yeah, failure is totally
accepted here. It is actually

0585 00:35:26:23 00:35:32:24

even better if you failed in
your profile, people value a lot

0586 00:35:33:01 00:35:39:02

that you failed and it's totally
okay, I fail every day

0587 00:35:39:04 00:35:42:14

in something. Guys who do really
well they are guys who have

0588 00:35:42:16 00:35:46:03

crashed another company before,
and the guys who haven't crashed

0589 00:35:46:05 00:35:49:06

another company yet this is the
company they need to crash.

0590 00:35:49:08 00:35:54:13

I made 30 million dollars when
I was 17 and lost it all by the

0591 00:35:54:15 00:35:57:21

time I was 20, and that
experience really made me

0592 00:35:57:23 00:36:01:18

realize that in life the most
important thing is the people

0593 00:36:01:20 00:36:05:06

around you and it is easy to
forget that and get caught up in

0594 00:36:05:08 00:36:09:04

the hype. You only get one
life. You got to live it.

0595 00:36:09:06 00:36:12:10

Don't forget to actually
enjoy it.

0596 00:36:12:12 00:36:15:19

Ben Way is an English serial
entrepreneur. He grew up in

0597 00:36:15:21 00:36:19:07

England and was early fascinated
with building businesses.

0598 00:36:19:09 00:36:23:08

He started a computer
consultancy at age 15. At 17 he

0599 00:36:23:10 00:36:26:13

had raised 40 million dollars,
making him one of the first dot

0600 00:36:26:15 00:36:30:11

com millionaires. By twenty he
had lost it all.

0601 00:36:31:01 00:36:34:17

I was always very different in
school. I'm severely dyslexic.

0602 00:36:34:19 00:36:38:00

I was told at 9 years old that
I would never read or write

0603 00:36:38:02 00:36:42:10

because I was pretty useless.
I still have trouble spelling

0604 00:36:42:12 00:36:45:02

business and entrepreneur is a
word I couldn't even possible

0605 00:36:45:04 00:36:49:23

hope to spell but I was very
lucky and one of the reason

0606 00:36:50:00 00:36:52:19

why I got into computers and
technology is that I was

0607 00:36:52:21 00:36:56:05

actually given a laptop at 9
years old to help me with my

0608 00:36:56:07 00:37:01:07

dyslexia and I was one of the
first of kids in the whole of UK

0609 00:37:01:09 00:37:03:22

to be given a laptop for
education.

0610 00:37:03:24 00:37:07:23

My first semi proper business
was at twelve years old. I

0611 00:37:08:00 00:37:13:10

bought some chickens and I
sold their eggs and I had a

0612 00:37:13:12 00:37:17:06

proper cash flow where I used
to look after the fee and check

0613 00:37:17:08 00:37:20:04

the sale of the eggs. You know
eggs have very good margins

0614 00:37:20:06 00:37:24:14

at twelve years old. After my
chicken business I started my

0615 00:37:24:16 00:37:28:02

first computer consultancy on my
15th birthday, charging 10

0616 00:37:28:04 00:37:31:23

pounds an hour and that was
really how I started a proper

0617 00:37:32:00 00:37:36:09

business. I think at the time I
was the youngest company

0618 00:37:36:11 00:37:40:09

director in the country and it
wasn't until few years later I

0619 00:37:40:11 00:37:44:04

raised twenty-five million pounds for
what was back then the

0620 00:37:44:06 00:37:46:16

first e�commerce search engine.

0621 00:37:46:18 00:37:50:18

At 21, after the Dot�com crash
in 2000 Ben's company

0622 00:37:50:20 00:37:57:03

went bankrupt. When I failed I
failed in spectacular fashion.

0623 00:37:58:12 00:38:04:24

I lost twenty million pounds. I
lost my car, the girl I loved,

0624 00:38:05:01 00:38:07:03

my house, I couldn't even
buy a tube ticket in the

0625 00:38:07:05 00:38:09:16

same day I was in
the rich list.

0626 00:38:09:18 00:38:12:21

But even after this experience
he decided to continue building

0627 00:38:12:23 00:38:17:06

businesses. In 2003 he started
Rainmakers, an innovation

0628 00:38:17:08 00:38:18:21

and venture company.

0629 00:38:18:23 00:38:23:01

So after I failed it did take me
a while to get back on my feet.

0630 00:38:23:03 00:38:27:11

After losing everything, it was
very hard time in my life.

0631 00:38:28:01 00:38:33:13

I ended up doing a reality TV
show and travelling the world.

0632 00:38:33:15 00:38:38:08

But entrepreneur is such a deep
part of me. It took about

0633 00:38:38:10 00:38:42:04

18 months, 2 years, to start my
own business again, but never

0634 00:38:42:06 00:38:45:24

any second does business leave
me. I'm always thinking of

0635 00:38:46:01 00:38:50:12

business so even after I failed
I was thinking of ideas for new

0636 00:38:50:14 00:38:55:21

businesses I could do. Sometimes
I wish I could quiet my mind

0637 00:38:55:23 00:39:00:04

a bit more often. But every second
by every day is consumed by

0638 00:39:00:06 00:39:02:06

the thought of making the
world a slightly better.

0639 00:39:02:08 00:39:07:04

It's been a, you know, a very
Long and challenging time. I had

0640 00:39:07:06 00:39:11:01

some great successes during that
time and great failures also.

0641 00:39:11:03 00:39:14:09

I just don't fear the failures
so much any more.

0642 00:39:24:03 00:39:27:03

Even tough so many companies
fail entrepreneurs continue to

0643 00:39:27:05 00:39:29:16

start new businesses in the
hopes that theirs will be that

0644 00:39:29:18 00:39:32:20

one in ten company that
succeeds. What does it

0645 00:39:32:22 00:39:35:16

take to build a
successful start�up?

0646 00:39:38:01 00:39:40:21

Successful startups needs a lot
of things. They need a great

0647 00:39:40:23 00:39:43:08

idea. They need a great team
and they need to be there at the

0648 00:39:43:10 00:39:46:08

right time and they need the
right level of funding

0649 00:39:47:03 00:39:48:05

and they need a lot of luck.

0650 00:39:48:07 00:39:51:13

There is a lot of luck in the
success of all business that

0651 00:39:51:15 00:39:57:05

have succeeded. There were 25
search engines funded before

0652 00:39:57:07 00:40:08:13

Google was funded. There were
Friendster and Linkedin and

0653 00:40:09:08 00:40:14:07

Myspace and about 50 others
before Facebook became the

0654 00:40:14:09 00:40:21:01

big winner in that area. There
is a little bit of luck that

0655 00:40:21:03 00:40:24:23

just happens where somebody
gets it just right. That could

0656 00:40:25:00 00:40:30:00

be skill, that they figured out
what the user really, really

0657 00:40:30:02 00:40:35:07

wants and that's the thing that
makes those big businesses.

0658 00:40:35:09 00:40:37:22

Some of it is that you are at
the right place at the right

0659 00:40:37:24 00:40:40:22

time and you get lucky.

0660 00:40:40:24 00:40:44:16

I think with any company there
is a lot of luck involved.

0661 00:40:45:11 00:40:48:01

You can have great idea and
work really hard and be really

0662 00:40:48:03 00:40:53:14

smart but the one thing that is
out of your control is timing.

0663 00:40:53:16 00:41:00:07

Absolutely, team is super
important, you know, big market

0664 00:41:01:22 00:41:05:14

I don't know, it's magic, it's
totally magic, it's all of that

0665 00:41:05:16 00:41:10:01

stuff and 9 out of 10 times
they fail and the one time it

0666 00:41:10:03 00:41:13:01

does work it happens in a
totally unexpected way.

0667 00:41:13:03 00:41:15:21

Look at Twitter, right, how big
was micro blogging when Twitter

0668 00:41:15:23 00:41:18:05

started. Look at Facebook, how
big was social networking when

0669 00:41:18:07 00:41:20:20

that started. Those weren't huge
interesting markets but that is

0670 00:41:20:22 00:41:24:20

what you hear from all VCs. That
is really what we look for in

0671 00:41:24:22 00:41:27:15

those investments. These weren't
really big investment at the

0672 00:41:27:17 00:41:31:19

time. Starting a company often
feels like series of miracles

0673 00:41:31:21 00:41:35:01

and you have to have one set of
really good thing happen right

0674 00:41:35:03 00:41:40:12

after the other. So it really
does feel like a lot of luck but

0675 00:41:40:14 00:41:45:02

at the same time if you really
work hard and try a lot of things

0676 00:41:45:04 00:41:47:05

and really experimental you can
create your own luck.

0677 00:41:47:07 00:41:48:21

And you can make these
miracles happen.

0678 00:41:48:23 00:41:52:04

When I was young I didn't know
what a entrepreneur was.

0679 00:41:54:06 00:41:59:06

I understood it as a catchall
word to define any independent

0680 00:41:59:08 00:42:02:08

small business person that is
just what I thought but it

0681 00:42:02:10 00:42:05:24

sounded pretentious to me.

0682 00:42:12:21 00:42:17:14

I can't even pinpoint where it
all came from but I just always

0683 00:42:17:16 00:42:22:03

had the impression that I was
going to invent things.

0684 00:42:25:14 00:42:29:01

Zach Klein is a 27 year old
entrepreneur. He is the

0685 00:42:29:03 00:42:32:17

co�founder of Vimeo, a popular
video sharing site, visited by

0686 00:42:32:19 00:42:37:06

50 million people each month. He
started his career working on

0687 00:42:37:08 00:42:41:05

website called College Humor.
Two of his friend from college

0688 00:42:41:07 00:42:44:04

started to post silly pictures
of themselves on the Internet in

0689 00:42:44:06 00:42:47:17

1999. Pretty soon the site was
getting a thousand visitors

0690 00:42:47:19 00:42:51:01

a week and Zach joined them
while he was still in college.

0691 00:42:52:05 00:42:56:24

I never thought about quitting
college. I loved college,
